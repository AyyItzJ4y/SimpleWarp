SimpleWarp
==========

SimpleWarp is the original warp plugin for PocketMine-MP. The goal of SimpleWarp is to make things painfully easy while covering the majority of use cases.


## `/addwarp <name> [<ip> <port>|<x> <y> <z> <level>|<player>]`
The addwarp command allows you to add new warp points to the plugin. You can add a warp based on your current location, another players location, a set of coordinates or the IP of another server.
